          <h2>Why Choose Doc's Pest Control?</h2>
          <!-- <p>
            With a passion for helping families and a wealth of experience, I founded Doc’s Pest Control. My mission was simple: to provide effective, safe, and reliable pest control services tailored to the unique needs of each household. I wanted to build a company where customers felt valued and understood, not just another number on a service call list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, with 9 years of experience, we proudly serve the community, ensuring homes remain pest-free and families can enjoy peace of mind!

          <p>
            With a passion for helping families and a strong background in pest
            control, I founded Doc’s Pest Control with a clear mission: to
            provide effective, safe, and reliable pest solutions tailored to
            each home’s unique needs. I saw too many companies treating
            customers like numbers—quick in, quick out, with little care for
            long-term results or real relationships. I wanted to change that by
            creating a company rooted in integrity, personal service, and
            genuine care for the people we serve.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the start, our focus has been on delivering high-quality
            service while educating homeowners about prevention and safety. We
            understand how disruptive pests can be to a household’s comfort and
            health, and we take pride in offering solutions that are both
            thorough and family-friendly. Every job we take on is handled with
            the same attention and commitment we’d give to our own homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, with over 9 years of hands-on experience, Doc’s Pest Control
            proudly serves families across the East Valley. We’re grateful to be
            a trusted part of the community, helping our neighbors protect what
            matters most. Whether it’s a one-time issue or ongoing prevention,
            we’re here to ensure your home stays pest-free—so you can enjoy
            peace of mind, year-round.
